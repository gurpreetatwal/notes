# Personal Finance

My very rough notes regarding all things personal finance as I start learning.

## Retirement Accounts
So which types of accounts are right for you? Every investor is different, but these general rules of thumb often apply
- Early years: Invest in Roth accounts and pay taxes now when your income is low.
- Middle years: Invest in a healthy mix of tax-deferred and tax-free accounts.
- Later years: Invest in tax-deferred accounts during your peak earning years and put off taxes until retirement, when your income may be lower.
