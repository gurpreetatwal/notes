# X11

> These notes are very much still in progress, but detail my understandings of X11 as I learn.

`xinit`:

- ubuntu package (`xinit`)
- provides both the `startx` and `xinit` commands
- provides `/etc/X11/xinit/{xinitrc,xserverrc}`
- `xserverrc` is meant for configuring the X server
  - default `xserverrc` just invokes `X`
- `xinitrc` is meant for configuring and starting a X client
  - default `xinitrc` just invokes `/etc/X11/Xsession` which does some voodoo
- `xinit` only reads `~/.xinitrc` and `~/.xserverrc`, DOES NOT read `/etc/...`

`startx`:

- bash script that wraps `xinit` and provides a "nicer" interface
- this script actually uses the default configuartion files in `/etc/X11/xinit/` as opposed to `xinit`
- loads files like `~/.Xresources` and `~/.Xmodmap` (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_X11/Starting_Sessions#xinit_and_startx)
